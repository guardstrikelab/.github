![Open Source at GuardStrike](https://github.com/guardstrikelab/.github/blob/main/images/guardstrike-open-ai.png) 

## Get Involved
Build high-fidelity simulated driving environment and execute evaluations against large-scale scenario library, enable comprehensive identification of the safety performance of autonomous driving systems.
Right now, open communities are building amazing software together, and there are excellent "good first issue" opportunities, if you're looking to get involved.
